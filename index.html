        <h3> Bodybuilding and fitness</h3>
        <p> On my free time I lift heavy weights at the gym.
          For me personally, going to the gym is a way to challenge myself physically and mentally,
           and to continually strive for self-improvement. It helps me to set and achieve goals,
            and to push myself beyond my perceived limits.
             working out in the gym has become an important part of my life.
